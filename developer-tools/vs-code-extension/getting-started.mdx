## Install the VS Code Extension

<a
  style={{
    height: "fit-content",
    display: "inline-block",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "8px",
    paddingTop: "0",
    paddingLeft: "16px",
    paddingRight: "12px",
    borderRadius: "15px",
    fontSize: "1rem",
    backgroundColor: "#3789ff",
    color: "white",
  }}
  href="vscode:extension/LaunchFlow.launchflow"
  onMouseOver={(e) => (e.currentTarget.style.backgroundColor = "#4994ff")}
  onMouseOut={(e) => (e.currentTarget.style.backgroundColor = "#3789ff")}
>
  Install in VS Code
</a>
Once installed you can open the extension by clicking the LaunchFlow logo in the
side bar, or by running the `LaunchFlow: Focus on Workspace View` VS Code command.

</Frame>

## Install BuildFlow

Install the BuildFlow Python framework. **BuildFlow** is the open source Python framework that powers the LaunchFlow platform.

```
pip install buildflow
```

## Create your First Application

The first screen of the extension houses all of the BuildFlow applications that are in your current workspace. You can always navigate back to this screen by clicking the `Home` icon in the top bar, or by click `Apps` in the hamburger menu.

To create your first application select `Create from Template`. This will open a prompt for you to select a template, select `BuildFlow Service`, and select a directory to save your application in. This will add the application to your workspace and should appear as `buildflow-service` on the `Apps` page.

<Tip>
  The application name is determined by your
  buildflow.yaml and
  you can update it at any time.
</Tip>

    alt="Service Template"
    src="/images/buildflow-service-template.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Run your Application Locally

Once your application is created you can select it by clicking the name (`buildflow-service`) on the `Apps` page. This will attach the VS Code extension to your application and allow you to run useful commands on it. Simply click `Run Locally` to run your application. This will open the `Launches` page attached to your run.

<Tip>
  You can also run your application by clicking the LaunchFlow Icon in the top
  right and selecting `Launch Run (local)` from any file in your application.
</Tip>

    alt="Runtime"
    src="/images/runtime.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Debug your Application Locally

From the `Launches` page you can perform many operations such as:

<div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Drain / Stop your Job</li>
      <li>View Metrics</li>
      <li>Visit the Swagger UI for OpenAPI docs</li>
      <li>Reopen the Logs</li>
    </ul>
    Once you are done you can stop your job by clicking `Drain Launch` or `Stop Launch`
    to stop your job.
  </div>
  <div>
    <Frame className="tailwind styles sm:hidden">
      <img
        style={{ maxHeight: "500px", margin: 0 }}
        alt="Running Local"
        src="/images/running-local.png"
      />
    </Frame>
  </div>
</div>

## Upgrade your Account

In order you launch a remote deployment you will need to upgrade your account to our [standard tier](https://www.launchflow.com/pricing). You can do this by navigating to the account page by clicking the `User` icon in the top bar, or by clicking `Account` in the hamburger menu.

Once on the account you can sign in with your Google or GitHub account, then click `Upgrade Account`. Once complete your account will be credited with $50 of free credit, and you can begin launching remote deployments!

    alt="Upgrade Account"
    src="/images/upgrade-account.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Deploy your Application Remotely

Navigate back to the `Apps` page and select the app you created above. Then click `Launch Deployment`. This will prompt you to connect a project to you application. Click `Yes` then enter a name for your project. Projects are a way to group your remote deployments together and you can create as many as you want. We recommend having one project per application.

{" "}

<Tip>
  You can also launch your application by clicking the LaunchFlow Icon in the
  top right and selecting `Launch Deploiyment (remote)` from any file in your
  application.

    src="/images/full-launch.gif"
  />
</Frame>

## Debug your Remote Application

<div>
    Once your deployment is launched it will open a similar UI to the local run. You can view the **status** of your deployment, **real-time metrics**, and **real-time logs**. You can also visit the URL that was assigned to your deployment to view your application from the `Services` tab.

    Once you are done you can stop your job by clicking `Drain Launch` or `Stop Launch`. This will stop your job.

    </Frame>
</div>

## View Historical Deployments

<div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2 space-x-2">
    <div>
      After your deployment is stopped you can view it at anytime by opening the `Launches` page by clicking the `Rocket` icon in the top bar or by clicking `Launches` in the hamburger menu. You can also view your deployments by clicking the `Services` icon in the top bar or by clicking `Services` in the hamburger menu.

      From this view you can click the deployment ID and view the status and **historical logs** of your deployment.
    </div>
