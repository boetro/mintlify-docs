LaunchFlow has four main components to understand. Accounts, Projects, Environments, and Deployments. These components are hierarchical in nature. An account can have many projects, a project can have many environments or deployments, and an environment can have many deployments.

| **Account**    | An account is the top level resource in LaunchFlow. When you first sign up for LaunchFlow an account will be created for you.     |
| **Project**    | A project is a container for your environments and deployments. In general you should have one project per buildflow application.                    |
| **Environment**    | An environment allows a deployment to be run with a specific saved configuration, an environment can only have one running deployment at a time.                |
| **Deployment** | A Deployment is an instance of a BuildFlow application running inside of LaunchFlow Cloud. Depoyments can be launched in a project if there is no configuration or in an environment. |

## Accounts

An account is the top level resource in LaunchFlow. When you first sign up for LaunchFlow an account will be created for you. 
All billing information is tied to your account; all of the usage from your [deployments](#deployments) will be billed to your account.

Inside of an account you can see:
- Your total usage for the month (CPU and $$)
- A list of projects that are contained in the account  

<Note>
    In the near future we will allow sharing accounts with users, and creating multiple accounts.
</Note>

## Projects

Projects can be created inside of an account. We recommend creating one project per BuildFlow application. When launching a deployment you must specify which project you want to launch the deployment in. For more details see our [guide on creating and managing projects](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/projects).

Inside of a project you can see:
- A history of all deployments for the project
- Configured environment in the project

<Note>
    In the near future we will allow sharing projects with users.
</Note>

## Environments

Environments allow you to save a configuration for running your deployment. You do this by creating an environment and configuring it with environment variables that will be set when a deployment is launched in the environment. For more details see our [guide on creating and managing environments](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/environments).

Inside of an environment you can see:
- A history of all deployments for the environment
- Configured environment variables for the environment
- The currently running deployment for the environment
- The deployment key that is used for authentication with the environment

<Note>
In the near future we will allow sharing environments with users.
</Note>

## Deployments

A deployment is created when you launch your BuildFlow application on LaunchFlow cloud.

Inside of a deployment you can see:
- Status of the deployment (running, stopped, etc)
- Project the deployment is in
- Environment the deployment is in
- Logs for the deployment
- Metrics for the deployment
- Previously updated deployments
- The URL that is serving your application
    - This will be a URL ending in `launchflow.app`
    - If you update a deployment it will be deployed to this same URL.
