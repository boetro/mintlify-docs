### Main Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line-up" title="Effortless Autoscaling">
    LaunchFlow will spin up and tear down new machines as needed. This means
    your system will automatically scale to whatever your current demands are.
    This ensures your system can handle any surge in traffic while still be cost
    effective during low traffic periods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="Pay for What You Use">
    Autoscaling combined with our usage based pricing means you only pay for
    what you use. No more paying for idle resources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Monitoring Best Practices">
    LaunchFlow automatically exports your logs and metrics to remote storage,
    meaning you can always see what is happening inside your system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrows-rotate" title="Zero Downtime Updates">
    Rollout changes with confidence that your users will experience zero down
    time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pure Python" icon="snake">
    All you need to do is write python code, never touch a docker image again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="files" title="Configured by Default">
    You can get started with LaunchFlow Cloud without touching a single
    configuration file. But if you have any custom requirements all the nobs and
    dials are available to customize your deployment.
