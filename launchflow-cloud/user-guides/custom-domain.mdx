title: Serve from a Custom Domain
---

To serve from a custom domain you can add a `CNAME` record to your DNS settings. This `CNAME` record should point to the url of you deployment.

<Tip>
    This URL will stay the same across updates to your deployment. See our [update guide](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/update-a-deployment) for more information.
</Tip>

| Host Name            | Type  | Data                                                      |
|----------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| \<HOST NAME TO MAP\> | CNAME | https://\<PROJECT_ID\>-\<DEPLOYMENT_ID\|ENV_NAME\>.launchflow.app |

You can find the URL of your deployment in the VS Code extension when attaching to a deployment, or by running the `launch deployments ping` command.
