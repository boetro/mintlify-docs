title: Setup Release Pipeline
---

Using the [launch CLI](/developer-tools/cli) you can easily setup a CI/CD pipeline for you application that runs anywhere (GitHub Actions, BuildKite, Jenkins, etc..).

To get started you will need to create the following:

- A [project](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/projects#creating-a-project), note the project ID once created you will need that to setup your release pipeline.
- [Environments](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/environments#creating-an-environment) (e.g. `dev` and `prod`) for your relase pipeline, save the deployment key somewhere secure. You will need this to deploy to your environments.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitHub Actions">
  You can use the [actions-deploy](https://github.com/launchflow/actions-deploy) and [actions-promote](https://github.com/launchflow/actions-promote) GitHub workflows to easily setup a release pipeline that is run on GitHub Actions.

  <Tip>
    We recommend setting up a [GitHub Environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments) for each environment in your release pipeline. This will allow you to easily track the status of your deployments in your github repository.
  </Tip>

  In the below example we will setup two workflows.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Deploy to Dev">
        The first workflow will deploy to our `dev` environment on every push to the `main` branch.
        <Tip>
          We recommend storing your project ID and deployment keys as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) and referencing them in your workflows. If you have multiple environments you can make these secrets specific to each environment (e.g. `LAUNCHFLOW_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_KEY` and `LAUNCHFLOW_PROD_DEPLOYMENT_KEY`).
        </Tip>
        ```yaml
        # .github/workflows/release-dev.yml
        on:
          workflow_dispatch:

        name: Release Dev
        concurrency: dev
        jobs:
          release-dev:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            permissions:
              contents: write
              pull-requests: write
              id-token: "write"
            environment: dev
            steps:
              - uses: "actions/checkout@v3"

              - name: Set up Python 3.10
                uses: actions/setup-python@v4
                with:
                  python-version: "3.10"

              - name: Install Dependencies
                run: |
                  pip install -r requirements.txt

              - name: Deploy to Dev
                uses: launchflow/actions-deploy@v1
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.LAUNCHFLOW_PROJECT_ID }}
                  environment_name: prod
                  deployment_key: ${{ secrets.LAUNCHFLOW_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_KEY }}
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Promote to Prod">
        The second workflow can be manually triggered to promote the `dev` deployment to `prod`.
        ```yaml
        # .github/workflows/promote-to-prod.yml
        on:
          workflow_dispatch:

        name: Release Prod
        concurrency: prod
        jobs:
          release-prod:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            permissions:
              contents: write
              pull-requests: write
              id-token: "write"
            environment: prod
            steps:
              - uses: "actions/checkout@v3"

              - name: Set up Python 3.10
                uses: actions/setup-python@v4
                with:
                  python-version: "3.10"

              - name: Deploy to Prod
                uses: launchflow/actions-promote@v1
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.LAUNCHFLOW_PROJECT_ID }}
                  from_environment_name: dev
                  to_environment_name: prod
                  deployment_key: ${{ secrets.LAUNCHFLOW_PROD_DEPLOYMENT_KEY }}
        ```
        <Tip>
            You can easily chain promotions for multi-stage release pipelines (e.g. `dev` -> `staging` -> `prod`) by adding new workflows that use [actions-promote](https://github.com/launchflow/actions-promote)
        </Tip>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    You can use the [launch deployments update-environment](/developer-tools/cli/reference/deployments#update-environment) and [launch deployments promote-environment](/developer-tools/cli/reference/deployments#promote-environment) commands to setup your release pipeline. Since these commands authenticate with the unique deployment key that was generated you can run them from any environment of your choosing.

    A release pipeline consisting of two environments (`dev` and `prod`) can be setup with the following commands:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Deploy to Dev">
        First we deploy to our `dev` environment:
        ```
        launch deployments update-environment \
            --project-id=$PROJECT_ID \
            --environment=dev \
            --dkey=$DEV_DEPLOYMENT_KEY
        ```
        <Tip>
          If there is no deployment running in dev this will launch a new one.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Promote to Prod">
        Next we promote the dev deployment to prod, if there is already a deployment running in prod it will update it otherwise a new deployment will be launched:
        ```
        launch deployments promote-environment \
            --project-id=$PROJECT_ID \
            --from=$FROM_ENVIRONMENT \
            --to=prod \
            --dkey=$PROD_DEPLOYMENT_KEY
        ```
        <Tip>
            You can easily chain promotions for multi-stage release pipelines (e.g. `dev` -> `staging` -> `prod`)
