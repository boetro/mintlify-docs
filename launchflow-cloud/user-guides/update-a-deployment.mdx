title: Update a Deployment
---

Updating a deployment allows you to migrate traffic to a new version of your application with **zero** downtime. This is useful for deploying new features, bug fixes, or rolling back to a previous version of your application.

<Note>
  To update a deployment the deployment **must** be running in an environment.

    Updating an environment is the same as deploying to an environment. If you deploy to a running environment, we will update the deployment with the new version of your application.

        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the <code>Apps</code> tab</li>
            <li>Select the application you want to deploy</li>

            <li>Select the environment you would like to update</li>
            <li>Provide the deployment key for the environment if it is not saved locally.</li>
            <li>Once running you can navigate to the `Services` tab to visit the URL assigned to your deployment</li>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    Use the [deployment update-environment](/developer-tools/cli/reference/deployments#update-environment) command from the root directory of your application to update a deployment in an environment.

    ```
    launch deployments update-environment \
        --project-id=$PROJECT_ID \
        --environment=$ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
        --dkey=$DEPLOYMENT_KEY
    ```

    <Tip>
      If you run this command and there is no deployment running in the environment it will launch a new one.
